Implements indexing techniques to optimize search performance for vast volumes of agricultural data.
UUID: Generates unique identifiers for tracking key entities within the system, including fields, equipment, and products.

##### Serialization: 
Handles the conversion of agricultural data to various formats, such as JSON or XML, for efficient data exchange.

##### Flyway: 
Manages database schema migrations, ensuring smooth updates and version control for the agricultural data.

##### AWS: 
Utilizes Amazon Web Services for cloud-based infrastructure, storage, and computing resources.

##### JMeter: 
Conducts performance testing to measure and optimize the platform's response time and throughput under different load scenarios.

##### Spring Batch: 
Implements batch processing for efficient handling of large-scale agricultural data processing tasks.

##### Eureka: 
Provides service registration and discovery for the microservices within the platform.

##### Ribbon: 
Implements client-side load balancing to distribute requests across multiple instances of key services.

##### Hystrix: 
Implements circuit breaker patterns to handle and recover from failures in distributed systems, ensuring system stability.

##### Prometheus and Grafana: 
Enables monitoring and visualization of agribusiness-specific metrics and performance data.

##### Circuit Breaker: 
Implements circuit breaker patterns to manage failures and maintain system stability.
Load Balancing: Ensures even distribution of workload across multiple instances of services, optimizing resource utilization.

##### Session: 
Implements 
session management for secure user authentication and authorization within the platform.

##### Logstash: 
Collects and centralizes log data from various components, facilitating effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

##### Kibana: 
Provides a visual interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log and performance data.

##### Redis: 
Implements Redis cache for improved performance and data caching, enabling faster access to frequently accessed data.

##### Spring Security: 
Provides robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access to the platform's resources.

##### OAuth: Implements 
OAuth protocol for secure and delegated authentication, allowing integration with third-party services.

##### JWT (JSON Web Tokens): 
Implements JWT-based authentication and authorization, enabling stateless and secure authentication for API endpoints.
